Loot is a NFT that took the NFT world by storm. It redefines what an NFT could be.
A characteristic of a loot NFT is all data is contained on chain. No IPFS or external hosting used.
They did this in a very gas efficient way for the minter as most computation is offloaded to the read function.
Loot has become a prime example on how to create on-chain NFTs.

This contract showcase how you will want to structure your contract to create an on-chain NFT,
the key is to not construct the metadata during minting, but offload everything to a read function.
Although deployment might be costly, it makes minting gas efficient.
